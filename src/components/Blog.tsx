        üöÄ My Favorite Tech Stack for Web Development When building web
        applications, choosing the right tech stack is crucial. Over time, I‚Äôve
        experimented with various technologies and frameworks, refining my stack
        to one that provides both performance and developer efficiency. In this
        article, I‚Äôll share my go-to tech stack for web development, why I use
        it, and how it helps me build scalable, maintainable applications.
        <h3 className="text-success">Frontend: React + Bootstrap üé®</h3>
